        <p class="small2">Scholarships are to reward a student’s academic achievement and educational programs. Whether you’re starting your career or you’re studying in high school to grow new abilities, receiving a scholarship is a big achievement. Talking about the economic benefits, scholarships are especially appealing to young aspirants who are simply beginning their careers as employees. Furthermore, taking a scholarship can open the way to various educational centres as well as employment opportunities. This is actually a Golden opportunity for genuine aspirants.

            The Indian education system has a lot of issues in it. One of the major issues is the poor quality of education in government schools and colleges. where there is a majority of underprivileged children who go to take education. Regardless of allocating Rs. 94,800 crores for the education sector. which is in the previous Union Budget and Rs. 99,300 crores in the budget of 2020-21. But still, there is no prevention in the high level of dropout rate in the schools, especially for intermediate classes.
            
            There is another reason for the dropouts. Which is apart from the financial condition is the poor quality of education in government institutions. This makes a student weigh their options and job opportunities in the informal sector so they can earn sooner than expected. This is to achieve quality education in private institutions, scholarship has become an important weapon.
            
            Scholarships are important for all. This is not only for college programs but also for school or post-education achievement.
            
            Here’s a list of top few reasons explaining the importance of scholarship in today’s education world.<br>
            
            <b>1. Increasing Cost:</b> The increase in the cost of college, school, and university fees is the number one reason scholarships are helpful for a student. Every year, there is a minimum  5% increase in the tuition fee, particularly for international students. Therefore, it is highly advantageous to enrol in programs that are fully funded and keep a student out of all the financial stress.<br>
            
            <b>2. Student Loan Rate is shooting up: </b> As per recent researches, huge numbers of urban families are engaged in mortgages and loans. Which is to send their students for higher studies. On top of that, the loan rate in banks gets high every year and this is why scholarships are important.<br>
            
            <b>3. Basic Living Expenses: </b> College or university students also have to go through with food and travel costs. These costs build up slowly and tend to cause a lot of harassment. It becomes all the much more difficult to deal with if the student and their family have already paid too much for the tuition fee. But receiving a scholarship that takes care of all these costs is highly advantageous.<br>
            
            <b>4. Study Abroad:</b> Scholarships are the best way a student can fulfil his or her dream of studying abroad. Applying for a reputed and prestigious program helps academically as well as personally. This provides students are able to get global exposure and develop their own interpersonal skills. Scholarships offered by well-established institutions basically cover all the expenses of a student. Sometimes, it is not the cost of the institution but the cost of the degree program that is too high. Such out of financial issues programs can be easily taken up through scholarships. Going for a good and fully funded program helps a candidate manage the degree of his or her choice.<br></p>
